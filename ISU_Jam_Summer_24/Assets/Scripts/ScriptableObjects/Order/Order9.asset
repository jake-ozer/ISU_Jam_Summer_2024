  orderContent: "Salutations my fellow alchemist,<br><br>An unfortunate incident
    occurred as I was experimenting with potions, and I have regrettably been turned
    into a zombie. While my flesh has rotted, my brain has not, and the idea of eating
    someone else\u2019s cerebellum is repulsive to me.<br><br>I was hoping you could
    create a potion to satisfy my hunger, so that I might avoid resorting to cannibalism\u2026
    I would make one myself, but I am hesitant to return to alchemy after what happened
    the last time.<br><br>Best regards,<br>A hungry alchemist with much to learn "
