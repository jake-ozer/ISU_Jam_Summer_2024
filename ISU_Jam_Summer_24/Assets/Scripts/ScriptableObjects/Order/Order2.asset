  orderContent: 'Underground hermit,\n Rumors have been spreading of a local party
    of dungeoneers pillaging local settlements. We are worried we are unprepared.
    A village elder suggested we seek your services. We will not be able to face
    them in a straight-up fight. We will try to persuade them to accept a courtesy
    drink. Fill it with poison. We have lots of gold to offer.\n Best,\n Dungeon
    Goblin '
