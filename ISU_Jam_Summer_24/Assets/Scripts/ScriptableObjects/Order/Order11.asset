    time since I visited, and I\u2019ve missed your company\u2014But unfortunately,
    I will have to delay my visit a bit longer. I\u2019ve been working on a big project\u2014a
    machine that looks and acts like a human! It worked, but somehow, my creation
    turned against me! I fear it has to go\u2026 <br><br>You know I don\u2019t believe
    in any of that magic mumbo jumbo, but your concoctions do always seem to work

    I can\u2019t leave my workshop with it ravaging the place.<br><br>Yours truly,<br>The
    Architect"
