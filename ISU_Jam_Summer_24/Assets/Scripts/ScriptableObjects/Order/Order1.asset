  orderContent: 'Hello esteemed alchemist, \nI have an urgent order for a poison
    that must be done post-haste! My mother in law is to visit our estate in the
    coming day, and I cannot bear to hear her spiel about her unequivocally mundane
    trip to the coastal territories. Could you make something to put her to sleep
    when she gets here? You must not kill her, my wife would be mortified. But for
    the gods'' sake, something needs to be done. \nBest, \nA fatigued nobleman '
