  orderContent: 'Greetings Alchemist,<br><br>I am a reclusive countess living in
    a grand yet empty castle, and I have found myself wandering the halls at night
    as of late, wishing for company. I have decided that the best course of action
    is to become a vampire, so that I may lure a curious and fair maiden to my estate
    with my devilish charm and superhuman beauty.<br><br>Unfortunately, I do not
    know any vampires who can turn me, as I do not have any friends. Perhaps a potion
    would work instead?<br><br>Sincerely,<br>A Romanian romantic '
